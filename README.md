# Particle Park

Particle Park is a showcase for community created particle effects for LibGDX.

## Premise

<img align="right" src="docs/images/fireworks-preview.gif"> With the success of the [Scene2D.UI Skins](https://ray3k.wordpress.com/artwork/) project, it was time address the community's next largest need: particle effects. Despite great support and an official editor, particle effect examples were few and far between. The goal of this project is to create an abundance of such examples that can be dropped into your very own game. The effects are to be framed in a simple catalog program using animation and selectable options to best represent their use in context.

## How to use

Download and run a [release version](https://github.com/raeleus/Particle-Park/releases) of Particle Park. Browse the different scenes and select an effect to download. See the [libGDX wiki](https://libgdx.com/wiki/graphics/2d/2d-particleeffects) on the subject of implementing particle effects in your games.

Adding your own particle effects to the catalog is a simple process. Just copy the associated particle files into the locally generated data folder of the scene you want to view them in. The effect will now be selectable on the next startup of the catalog.
